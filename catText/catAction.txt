makes mewing sounds
meows
softly rumbles with purring sounds
lays on the ground
grooms itself
plays with a ball of yarn
rolls on the floor
chases butterflies
wants to be petted
wants to be fed
licks chops
yawns and lays down,
chases its tail
plays with random lint ball
thinks it is the best day ever again,
runs around
licks paws
wants to play
whips tail around
rubs its face against the door,
looks back and forth at the wall for hours
rabbit foots himself in the face
rubs against the floor,
runs in circles
cant wait for the best day ever tomorrow
flops around on the floor wanting to be pet,
wants to go on a journey
wishes there was more time to sleep in the day
wants to live in a world of fish,
gets underneath everyones feet
scratches the furniture up
meows incessantly
playfully attacks long grass,
waves tail around,knocks over things on the counters
sheds everywhere
runs in circles then into the wall,rolls into a bowl of food,
meows for hours for no reason
wants to make new friends today
wishes there were more people to play with,
wants there to be fish forever
wishes he never had to stop sleeping
lays in the sun
gets high on catnip
wants more catnip,
wishes catnip were free
is addicted to catnip
